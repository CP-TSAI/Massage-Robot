#### ABSTRACT
- The objective of this research is to present a **percussive massage based on robotic tapping motion**.
- It is the first research to discuss the massage technique for this kind. 

#### Difficulties:
- The tapping motion is different from the common contact motion, the end-effector has an initial velocity and acceleration while generating an impulse contact.
- How can the robot exert the desired force while making sure the safety?
- How can the for fit itself to different human body?

#### Solutions:
- To tackle with the tapping motion problems, we utilize the online trajectory generator (OTG) based on the **impedance control**, which ensures safety of humans. 
- By the **Cartesian Space Teach and Play Feedback Function** and the **Concept of Virtual Point**, the tapping force and contact position can be changed adaptively to meet different needs.
